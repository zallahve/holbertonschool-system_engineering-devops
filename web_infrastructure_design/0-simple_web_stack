What is a server?

A server is a computer (physical or virtual) that provides services to other computers over a network (here: serving a website).

Role of the domain name

The domain name (foobar.com) is a human-friendly name that maps to an IP address via DNS, so users don’t need to remember 8.8.8.8.

What DNS record type is www in www.foobar.com?

It’s an A record (because it points to an IPv4 address: 8.8.8.8).

Role of the web server (Nginx)

Nginx:

accepts incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests

serves static files (images/css/js) if needed

forwards dynamic requests to the application server (reverse proxy)

Role of the application server

The application server executes your backend code (business logic) and generates dynamic responses (HTML/JSON), often by talking to the database.

Role of the database (MySQL)

MySQL stores and retrieves persistent data (users, posts, products, sessions, etc.).

What does the server use to communicate with the user’s computer?

It communicates over the network using TCP/IP, and the web traffic is typically HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443).

What are the issues with this infrastructure? (must mention)
SPOF (Single Point of Failure)

Everything is on one server. If it dies (hardware, OS, disk, network), the whole site is down.

Downtime during maintenance/deployments

Restarting Nginx/app server, deploying code, or DB maintenance can cause temporary outage because there’s no redundant instance.

Cannot scale for high traffic

One machine has limited CPU/RAM/network. If traffic grows, it becomes slow or unavailable (no load balancer, no horizontal scaling).
