1) Why add one more server?

To increase capacity and availability by distributing responsibilities and removing overload from a single machine.

2) Why add a second load balancer (HAProxy cluster)?

Because a single load balancer is a SPOF. Two LBs in a cluster provide redundancy:

if LB1 fails, LB2 takes over, keeping the site reachable.

Common clustering method:

Keepalived / VRRP provides a Virtual IP (VIP) that moves from LB1 to LB2 on failure.

3) Why split components onto their own servers?

To scale and secure each layer independently:

Web server (Nginx): optimized for HTTP handling, static assets, reverse proxy

Application server: runs business logic; can scale horizontally without affecting DB

Database server (MySQL): needs strong disk I/O, backups, restricted access; isolate for security and performance

Benefits you should mention (short):

independent scaling (web/app/db scale differently)

less resource contention

smaller blast radius (if web is compromised, DB is not sitting on same host)

easier maintenance and tuning per role EOF
